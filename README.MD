# Klump WHMCS Module
Klump payment gateway module for WHMCS.

## How to use
- Locate the `Code` button with green color, click on it and select `Download ZIP`
- Unzip the downloaded file and copy the contents in`modules/gateways` folder to your WHMCS `modules/gateays` folder..

### Things To Note
The `verify-payment.php` file handles payment verification just as callbacks works on WHMCS. 

This will be prepopulated on the callback URL field for Klump gateway settings.

* Implement webhook callback (3days from now).
